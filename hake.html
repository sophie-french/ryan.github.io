                    <p>A friend recently asked me what my favourite fish I've seen on a dive is. The first thing that came to mind is all the HUGE pike and carp I've spotted in the rivers and lakes of Luxembourg, but then I remembered a fish I'm very fond of: the Hake. The fish is native to the North Atlantic, where it lives in relatively deep water. It has a maximum length of up to 3 feet and a maximum weight of up to 9 pounds. Although it's not very big, it is a stunning fish that regularly surprises divers. It's not uncommon to see them on divers' shoulders or on their hats as a lot of divers find it hard to believe that this little fish can make such a big impression on them.</p>

                    <p>Even though raw hake is a bit bland and tasteless, on a dive it can actually be quite beautiful. It's silvery colouration and slender body make it a lovely addition to anyreef, even though it's a little plain.</p>

                    <p>I often see hake hidden in the sand, waiting for small prey (mostly shrimp, I think) to swim by. When one swims by, the hake accelerates at a tremendous speed to snare it with its teeth. I'm always a little bit amazed by how these fish can be so well camouflaged and yet so deadly-fast.</p>
